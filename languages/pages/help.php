		<h2>3D Building Websites</h2>
		A "Building" is a single 3D structure with all of its parts. It can be a house, building, wall, tower, shack, tree, sign, or anything else you wish to create. You can create as many buildings as you like.<br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="wtw_admincommunities" class="wtw-helpdiv">
		<h2>3D Community Websites</h2>
		A "Community" is where we can display one or more buildings with all of the surrounding and connecting items such as roads, sidewalks, trees, brush, street signs, bridges, landscape, mountains, or anything else you wish to create. You can also create as many communities as you like.<br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="wtw_adminbuildvscomm" class="wtw-helpdiv">
		<h2>3D Buildings Vs. 3D Communities</h2>
		The top menu is divided into two major sections; 3D Buildings and 3D Communities.  When you select one or the other, additional related menu items will appear. For most top menu items, there are also corresponding options that will appear on the left side of the screen.<br /><br />
		<h3>Bring it Together</h3>
		One 3D Building can be added to multiple 3D Communities. Any changes you make to a 3D Building will automatically be shown in all of the 3D Communities containing that 3D Building.<br /><br />

	<div id="wtw_adminbuildingblocks" class="wtw-helpdiv">
		<h2>3D Building Blocks</h2>
		3D Building Blocks are the 3D geometric shapes that are combined to make 3D Things, 3D Buildings, 3D Communities. <br />They include but are not limited to:
		<ul>
			<li>Boxes (Walls, Floors, cubes, etc.)</li>
			<li>Spheres</li>

When selected, a new 3D Thing will immediately appear directly in front of you along with a settings window. Name your new 3D Thing and click save. Once you create or download a 3D Thing, you can modify or change it any way you like. Keep in mind that when you place it in a 3D Building or 3D Community any changes you make here will update the 3D Thing everywhere. You can always create a copy of a 3D Thing to have a new Instance for changes without affecting the original 3D Thing.<br /><br />
		<h3>Add a 3D Thing to a 3D Building or 3D Community</h3>
		To <b>add</b> a 3D Thing, select Building or Community Tools from the top menu, then select <b>Add 3D Things</b> from the options on the left to see the selection list of 3D Things.
